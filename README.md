# Secure Login System - McMaster Engineering Competition 2024 

Welcome to the Secure Login System project! 👨‍💻🔒

This project was created as part of the McMaster Engineering Competition 2024, where I led a team of four to build a secure login system. The goal was to create a reliable and secure platform to manage user authentication, while also making it easy to use and efficient. 

## About the Project
Our system is designed to provide a highly secure and user-friendly login experience. We wanted to make sure that users' personal information and passwords are protected with the best possible security measures. 

## Key Features:
• Secure Password Hashing: Used Argon2id with extra salt for secure password hashing. 🔐 <br>
• Multi-Factor & Biometric Authentication: Integrated multi-factor and biometric login options. 📱 <br>
• User-Friendly Interface: Designed a simple, fast UI with Python's Tkinter. 💻 <br>
• Non-Relational Database: Built a custom JSON & hash table database to minimize storage. 🗄️ <br>
