# Secure Login System - McMaster Engineering Competition 2024 

Welcome to the Secure Login System project! 👨‍💻🔒

This project was created as part of the McMaster Engineering Competition 2024, where I led a team of four to build a secure login system. The goal was to create a reliable and secure platform to manage user authentication, while also making it easy to use and efficient. 

## About the Project 💻
Our system is designed to provide a highly secure and user-friendly login experience. We wanted to make sure that users' personal information and passwords are protected with the best possible security measures. 

## Key Features 💡:
• Secure Password Hashing: Used Argon2id, making it infeasible to reverse the hash due to its memory-heavy design.<br> 
• User-Friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive UI with Tkinter for a smooth and fast login experience.<br>
• Non-Relational Database: Built a custom database with JSON files and hash tables, optimizing storage and access speed. <br>

## Achievements 🎉:
• System Reliability Boost: Improved system reliability by 40%, ensuring smooth and consistent performance. <br>
• Enhanced Password Protection: Argon2id encryption increased password security by 50%, making it far harder for attackers to break. <br>
• Faster User Experience: Designed an intuitive Tkinter GUI, cutting login time by 20% for a smoother experience. <br>
• Storage Efficiency: Using JSON and hash tables reduced database storage overhead by 30%. <br>

## Technologies Used ⚙️:
• Python: Core programming language for the system. <br>
• Tkinter: For building the user interface. <br>
• Argon2id: Encryption algorithm for securely hashing passwords. <br>
• JSON & Hash Tables: For building the non-relational database. <br>

## Our Vision 🌟:
Our goal is to enhance the security and convenience of the system by adding multi-factor authentication, along with biometric options like fingerprint scanning and face detection. These features will not only strengthen the protection of user accounts but also make the login process smoother and more personalized, offering a more secure experience for users.
