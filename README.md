# Secure Login System - McMaster Engineering Competition 2024 

Welcome to the Secure Login System project! 👨‍💻🔒

This project was created as part of the McMaster Engineering Competition 2024, where I led a team of four to build a secure login system. The goal was to create a reliable and secure platform to manage user authentication, while also making it easy to use and efficient.
