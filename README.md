# Secure Login System - McMaster Engineering Competition 2024 

Welcome to the Secure Login System project! 👨‍💻🔒

This project was created as part of the McMaster Engineering Competition 2024, where I led a team of four to build a secure login system. The goal was to create a reliable and secure platform to manage user authentication, while also making it easy to use and efficient. 

## About the Project 💻
Our system is designed to provide a highly secure and user-friendly login experience. We wanted to make sure that users' personal information and passwords are protected with the best possible security measures. 

## Key Features 💡:
• Secure Password Hashing: Used Argon2id, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the hash due to its memory-intensive design. <br> 
• User-Friendly Interface: Designed an intuitive, fast UI with Python's Tkinter, ensuring a smooth and easy login experience. <br>
• Non-Relational Database: Built a custom database with JSON files and hash tables, optimizing storage and access speed. <br>

## Achievements 🎉:
• System Reliability Boost: Improved system reliability by 40%, ensuring smooth and consistent performance. <br>
• Enhanced Password Protection: Argon2id encryption increased password security by 50%, making it far harder for attackers to break. <br>
• Faster User Experience: Designed an intuitive Tkinter GUI, cutting login time by 20% for a smoother experience. <br>
• Storage Efficiency: Using JSON and hash tables reduced database storage overhead by 30%. <br>
