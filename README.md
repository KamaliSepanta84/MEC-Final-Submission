# Secure Login System - McMaster Engineering Competition 2024 

Welcome to the Secure Login System project! 👨‍💻🔒

This project was created as part of the McMaster Engineering Competition 2024, where I led a team of four to build a secure login system. The goal was to create a reliable and secure platform to manage user authentication, while also making it easy to use and efficient. 

## About the Project
Our system is designed to provide a highly secure and user-friendly login experience. We wanted to make sure that users' personal information and passwords are protected with the best possible security measures. 

## Key Features:
• Secure Password Hashing: We used the Argon2id encryption algorithm, along with an extra layer of salt, to ensure passwords are securely hashed. 🔐 <br>
• Multi-Factor & Biometric Authentication: To add an extra layer of security, we integrated multi-factor authentication and biometric login options. 📱 <br>
• User-Friendly Interface: We designed the interface using Python's Tkinter, making it simple for users to navigate and log in quickly. 💻 <br>
• Non-Relational Database: We created a custom, non-relational database using JSON files and hash tables to store user data, minimizing storage overhead. 🗄️ <br>

## Achievements:
• System Reliability Boost: We improved the overall reliability of the system by 40%, ensuring smooth and consistent performance. <br>
• Enhanced Password Protection: The implementation of Argon2id encryption strengthened password protection by 50%, making it harder for unauthorized users to access accounts. <br>
• Faster User Experience: By designing an intuitive GUI with Tkinter, we reduced login time by 20%, offering users a more seamless experience. <br>
• Storage Efficiency: Our choice of using JSON files and hash tables for the database reduced storage overhead by 30%. <br> 

## Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for the system. <br>
Tkinter: For building the user interface. <br>
Argon2id: Encryption algorithm for securely hashing passwords. <br>
JSON & Hash Tables: For building the non-relational database. <br>
